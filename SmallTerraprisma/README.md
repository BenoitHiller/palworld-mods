Makes the glowing blades spawned by the Terraprisma much smaller so they don't block your vision as much.

### Caveats

So I'm aware of the following quirks and hope to fix them in the future:

* The particle effects are not scaled down to match the model.
* I had to remove the cool after-image style effect on the swords because when not scaled it renders huge bright lines as big as the swords normally are.
* I want to reduce the spacing between the two sets of blades, but that spacing is implemented in code that I couldn't get at easily.

For now it gets the job done but I think it could be prettier.

# Installation

The recommended method is to install the mod by subscribing on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3642921096).

After you subscribe to the mod, do these steps to enable the mod:

1. Launch the game and wait until you get to the title screen.
2. Go to Options > Mod Management and make sure **Enable Mod** is set to **ON**.
3. Make sure the checkboxes next to Smaller Terraprisma, UE4SS Experimental (Palworld), and PalSchema are **CHECKED**
4. Click the blue **Save** button and the game will now restart.
5. Once the game starts up again, Smaller Terraprisma should now be enabled.

## Manual Installation

If you want to install the mod outside of Steam or if you are using versions of UE4SS or PalSchema that don't come from the Steam Workshop you will need to install the mod manually.

To do so first you will need to ensure you have set up UE4SS and PalSchema, see this guide for step by step instructions.

Then download the latest version of the mod [on NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/3228) and extract the zip file into your Palworld game folder.
